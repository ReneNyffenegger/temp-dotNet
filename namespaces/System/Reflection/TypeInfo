Represents type declarations for class types, interface types, array types,
value types, enumeration types, type parameters, generic type definitions, and
open or closed constructed generic types.


A System.Reflection.TypeInfo object represents the type definition itself, whereas a System.Type object represents a reference to the type definition. 
-
Getting a TypeInfo object forces the assembly that contains that type to load
-
In comparison, you can manipulate Type objects without necessarily requiring the runtime to load the assembly they reference.

System.Reflection.TypeInfo contains many of the members available in the System.Type class, and many of
the reflection properties in the .NET for Windows 8.x Store apps return
collections of TypeInfo objects. To get a TypeInfo object from a Type object,
use the IntrospectionExtensions.GetTypeInfo(Type) extension method.
