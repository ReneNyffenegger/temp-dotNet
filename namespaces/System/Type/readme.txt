`System.Type` is the root of the System.Reflection functionality and is the primary way to access metadata.

Type is an abstract base class that allows multiple implementations. The system will always provide the derived class RuntimeType

In reflection, all classes beginning with the word Runtime are created only once per object in the system and support comparison operations.
