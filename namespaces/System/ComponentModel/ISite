Provides functionality required by sites.

Sites bind a `System.ComponentModel.Component` to a `System.ComponentModel.Container` and enable communication between them, as well as provide a way for the container to manage its components.  


A `System.ComponentModel.Component` interacts with its container primarily through a container-provided System.ComponentModel.ISite, which is a repository of container-specific per-component information.
