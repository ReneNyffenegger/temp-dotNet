When using the namespace System.Management.Automation in a c# project,
apparently, the assembly System.Management.Automation.dll needs to be
explicitely specified to csc.exe (/reference:â€¦, see interpreter.cs in the
temp-dotnet github project)
-
The location of the System.Management.Automation assembly can be found in a PowerShell console with:
  [psobject].assembly.location
