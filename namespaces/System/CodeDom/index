The System.CodeDom namespace contains classes that can be used to represent the elements and structure of a source code document.

   Originally in the .NET framework, csc.exe was a self-contained binary
   responsible for compiling C# source code to IL. But it was opaque and its
   command-line interface limited what could be achieved by invoking it.
   
   Microsoft introduced the System.CodeDom namespace and classes as a way for
   their own tools to generate code (e.g. the Windows Forms designer in Visual
   Studio), but pretty much everyone started using it because it was miles better
   than csc.exe. However given what it was created for, CodeDOM suffers from
   numerous limitations and edge cases that make it less than ideal for certain
   non-compilation tasks - and at the end of the day it simply invokes csc.exe to
   produce compiled code.
