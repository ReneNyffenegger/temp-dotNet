System.Array is the base class for arrays in .NET languages that have an array type.

msdn: Unlike the classes in the System.Collections namespaces, System.Array has a fixed capacity.

msdn: An Array can have any lower bound, but it has a lower bound of zero by default. 

msdn: A multidimensional Array can have different bounds for each dimension. An array can have a maximum of 32 dimensions.




---------------------


The Array class is not part of the System.Collections namespaces.
-
However, it is based on the Systems.Collections.IList interface, so, it
is still considered a collection.
