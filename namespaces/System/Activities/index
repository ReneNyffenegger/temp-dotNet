System.Activities seems to be the namespace for Windows Workflow Foundation

In .NET 4 the Workflow Team released an all new Workflow engine in the
System.Activities namespace. With the release of .NET 4.5 Beta we are marking
most of the types in the "WF 3" System.Workflow.Activities,
System.Workflow.ComponentModel, and System.Workflow.Runtime namespaces as
obsolete.
