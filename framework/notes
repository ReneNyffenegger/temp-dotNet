The .NET Framework consists of two main components, which are versioned separately:
  - A set of assemblies, which are collections of types and resources that
    provide the functionality for your apps. The .NET Framework and assemblies
    share the same version number.
  - The common language runtime (CLR), which manages and executes your app's 
    code. The CLR is identified by its own version number
