  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator#storage-emulator-command-line-tool-reference :
  The easiest way to connect to the storage emulator from your application is
  to configure a connection string in your application's configuration file
  that references the shortcut UseDevelopmentStorage=true. Here's an example of
  a connection string to the storage emulator in an app.config file:

  <appSettings>
    <add key="StorageConnectionString" value="UseDevelopmentStorage=true" />
  </appSettings>
