-- objects that reference unmanaged resources implement the IDisposable interface. When you're done using the object, you call the object's Dispose() method, which is responsible for releasing any unmanaged resources

using System.IO;

using (FileStream stream = GetFileStream(context))
{

     // Once the using block completes, the .NET runtime automatically calls
     // the stream object's Dispose() method, which releases the file handle.

    // Operations on the stream
}
